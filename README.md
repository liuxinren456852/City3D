### Obtaining City3D

You can build City3D from the source codeË™

* Download the [source code](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D).
* Dependencies
    - [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) (v5.12 and later). This is required by only the [GUI demo](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/tree/main/code/City3D) of City3D. 
      Without Qt, you should still be able to build the two commandline programs [Example_1](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/tree/main/code/CLI_Example_1) and [Example_2](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/tree/main/code/CLI_Example_2).
    - [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org/index.html) (v5.4 and later).
    - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/) (v4.0 and later, only the main modules are needed).
    - [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/). **Note for Linux users:** You may have to build the Gurobi library (`libgurobi_c++.a`) 
      because the prebuilt one in the original package might NOT be compatible with your compiler. To do so, go to `src/build` 
      and run `make`. Then replace the original `libgurobi_c++.a` (in the `lib` directory) with your generated file.

* Build
    - There are many ways to build City3D. Choose one of the following (or whatever you are familiar with):
        - Option 1: Use any IDE that can directly handle CMakeLists files to open the CMakeLists.txt in the root directory of City3D. Then you should have obtained a usable project and just build. I recommend using [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).
        - Option 2: Use CMake to generate project files for your IDE. Then load the project to your IDE and build.
        - Option 3: Use CMake to generate Makefiles and then `make` (on Linux/macOS) or `nmake`(on Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio). For Windows users,  you can also install Linux on Windows with  [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). For Linux or macOS, you can simply
            ```
            $ cd City3D
            $ mkdir Release
            $ cd Release
            $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
            $ make
            ```

### Run City3D

This repository includes three executable programs:

- [Example_1](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/tree/main/code/CLI_Example_1): a commandline program that can reconstruct multiple buildings in a large scene using 
both point cloud and footprint as input.
- [Example_2](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/tree/main/code/CLI_Example_2): a commandline program showing the reconstruction of all the pre-segmented buildings in
a large scene using only the point clouds as input. The individual buildings have already been segmented and each 
building is stored as a separate point cloud file. Our method generates footprint for each building and then reconstructs it.
- [City3D](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/tree/main/code/City3D): a demo version of our method with GUI. This demo provides a simple user interface with 
a few buttons (with numbered icons). Just click the buttons one by one in the specified order to run the workflow. 
The UI was adapted from [PolyFit](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/PolyFit).

### Data
Some test data can be found [here](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/tree/main/data).
Two ways to use our method:
- Both point cloud and footprint are available (see the [data](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/tree/main/data) directory), see [Example_1](./code/CLI_Example_1).
- Only point cloud of building instances is available (see the [building_instances](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/tree/main/data/building_instances) directory), the method can generate footprint for each building and then reconstruct it, See [Example_2](./code/CLI_Example_2).

### About the solvers
This demo program can use either the open-source SCIP solver or the commercial solver Gurobi for the [core optimization](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/blob/main/code/method/face_selection_optimization.cpp) step. The entire source code 
of the SCIP solver is already included in this repository. Note: the [polygon regularization](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/blob/main/code/method/regularize_polygon.cpp) step still requires Gurobi.

The Gurobi solver is faster than SCIP and is thus highly recommended. To use Gurobi, install it first and make sure 
the headers and libraries of Gurobi can be found by CMake. This can be done by specifying the paths of Gurobi in [FindGUROBI.cmake](./code/cmake/FindGUROBI.cmake). 
Note: you need to [obtain a license](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/) to use Gurobi, which is free for academic use.

## TODOs
This is an academic prototype of LoD2 building reconstruction from LiDAR point clouds. Many intermediate steps can be improved.
- [ ] Release the dataset. 
- [ ] Support SCIP for [RegularizePolygon](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City3D/blob/main/method/regularize_polygon.cpp) (currently requires Gurobi).
